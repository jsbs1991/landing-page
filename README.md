# landing-page
css landing page Project
This is the The Landing Page project from The Odin Project.
It is to demonstrate the skills learned in the CSS section using flexboxes and other CSS elements.
I recreated the webpage from an image provided by The Odin Project along with the formatting information.
This landing page is the first I have made and hope to keep making them, this might not have the best practices
and might not be the most efficient ways of doing this. But with more webpages that I will continue to make, I will become more efficient and faster at creating. 
Thank you for reading this.
